## Introduction to SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard programming language for managing relational databases. It is used for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Basic SQL Queries

Basic SQL queries involve operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for retrieving, adding, modifying, and deleting data from a database table.

## Joins

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Common types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN.

## Subqueries

Subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are queries nested within another query. They are used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition or value.

## Indexes

Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They help in quickly locating and accessing the rows based on the indexed columns.

## Transactions

Transactions are units of work that are performed against a database. They ensure the consistency and integrity of the database by allowing a series of operations to be treated as a single, indivisible operation.

## Views

Views are virtual tables based on the result set of a SELECT statement. They provide an abstraction layer over the underlying tables, allowing users to query the view as if it were a regular table.

## Stored Procedures

Stored procedures are a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed later as a single unit. They help in encapsulating complex logic and promoting code reusability.

## Triggers

Triggers are special types of stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. They are used to enforce data integrity constraints or to perform auditing tasks.

## Advanced SQL Techniques

Advanced SQL techniques include Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and other features that provide powerful capabilities for data manipulation and analysis.
